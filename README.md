```markdown
# AI Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

A computer vision project that detects pedestrians, vehicles, and road signs in real-time using **YOLOv8 & YOLOv11**.  
The system is optimized for speed, accuracy, and adaptability under poor lighting and weather conditions.

## 🚀 Features
- 🚗 Real-time object detection
- 🌙 Works in low light & adverse weather
- 📊 Supports multiple object classes
- ⚡ Optimized for speed with GPU acceleration

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, YOLOv8, YOLOv11
- **Languages**: Python
- **Tools**: OpenCV, NumPy

## 📦 Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection.git
cd object-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python detect.py --source test.mp4
